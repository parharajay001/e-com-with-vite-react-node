# E-Commerce Platform Project Overview

## Project Architecture

### Monorepo Structure (Turborepo)

- Uses pnpm workspace for package management
- Organized into apps and shared packages
- Leverages Turborepo for build system optimization

### Frontend (React + Vite)

- **Tech Stack:**
  - React 19.x with TypeScript
  - Vite for fast development and building
  - Material-UI (MUI) as the component library
  - AG Grid for data tables
  - Formik + Joi for form management and validation
  - React Router for navigation
  - Redux Toolkit for state management
  - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

### Backend (Node.js)

- **Tech Stack:**
  - Express.js with TypeScript
  - Prisma as ORM
  - MySQL database
  - JWT for authentication
  - Winston for logging
  - Express middleware for security (helmet, cors, rate-limiting)
  - Testing with Mocha, Chai, and Supertest

### Shared Packages (Internal)

1. **@workspace/config**

   - Shared configuration utilities
   - API configuration and types
   - Axios instance configuration

2. **@workspace/router**

   - Centralized routing logic
   - Route guards for authentication
   - Custom hooks for navigation

3. **@workspace/store**

   - Redux store configuration
   - Shared state management
   - Common reducers and actions

4. **@workspace/ui**
   - Shared UI component library
   - Theme configuration
   - Reusable components like DataTable, Forms, Layout
   - MUI customization
